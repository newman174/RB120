# Consistent Classes > Ruby Style: Classes & Modules
# => Use a consistent structure in your class definitions.

class Person
  # extend/include/prepend go first
  extend SomeModule
  include AnotherModule
  prepend YetAnotherModule

  # inner classes
  CustomError = Class.new(StandardError)

  # constants are next
  SOME_CONSTANT = 20

  # afterwards we have attribute macros
  attr_reader :name

  # followed by other macros (if any)
  validates :name

  # public class methods are next in line
  def self.some_method
  end

  # initialization goes between class methods and other instance methods
  def initialize
  end

  # followed by other public instance methods
  def some_method
  end

  # protected and private methods are grouped near the end
  protected

  def some_protected_method
