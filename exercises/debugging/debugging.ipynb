Line 47 calls `puts` with the argument `blog_post`. `puts` calls `to_s` on its argument (the `MarkdownFile` referenced by the local variable `blog_post`), outputs the return value of `to_s`, and returns `nil`. Calling `to_s` on `blog_post` is a call to the definition on line 20, which contains a reference to a constant named `FORMAT`. The issue is that the assignments of `FORMAT` within each of the `File` subclasses is not in the lookup path for the reference on line 20. When trying to resolve a reference to a constant, Ruby first looks in the lexical scope of the constant, which are the enclosing classes or modules of the reference, starting with the innermost one containing the reference and moving outward. If it doesn't find it in the lexical scope, then it looks to the inheritance hierarchy of the calling object. If it doesn't find it in the inheritance hierarchy, it finally looks for it in the top-level scope, which are constants implicitly defined in the `Object` class. Here the lookup path is:\n","* lexical: `File.to_s`, `File`\n","* inheritance: `File`, `Object` and the ancestors of `Object`,\n","* top-level: none\n","\n","The problem can be fixed by changing the reference on line 21 from `FORMAT` to `self.class::FORMAT`. This tells ruby to look in the calling object's class for the constant, rather than in the module. If we make that change, the program will find the relevant constant in the subclass definition."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"ename":"NameError","evalue":"uninitialized constant #<Class:0xb3f3a364>::CoolMod::MY_CONSTANT","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[31mNameError\u001b[0m: uninitialized constant #<Class:0xb3f3a364>::CoolMod::MY_CONSTANT","(irb):2:in `k_printer'","(irb):12:in `say_something'","(irb):16:in `<top (required)>'"]}],"source":["module CoolMod\n","  def k_printer\n","    MY_CONSTANT\n","  end\n","end\n","\n","class NewClass\n","  include CoolMod\n","  \n","  MY_CONSTANT = 'This guy'\n","\n","  def say_something\n","    puts k_printer\n","  end\n","end\n","\n","NewClass.new.say_something"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["This guy\n"]}],"source":["module SomeModule\n","  def k_printer\n","    self.class::MY_CONSTANT\n","  end\n","end\n","\n","class CoolClass\n","  include SomeModule\n","  \n","  MY_CONSTANT = 'This guy'\n","\n","  def say_something\n","    puts k_printer\n","  end\n","end\n","\n","CoolClass.new.say_something"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["(irb):25: warning: already initialized constant #<Class:0x00005561ea1c2658>::MarkdownFile::FORMAT\n","(irb):25: warning: previous definition of FORMAT was here\n","(irb):29: warning: already initialized constant #<Class:0x00005561ea1c2658>::VectorGraphicsFile::FORMAT\n","(irb):29: warning: previous definition of FORMAT was here\n","(irb):33: warning: already initialized constant #<Class:0x00005561ea1c2658>::MP3File::FORMAT\n","(irb):33: warning: previous definition of FORMAT was here\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["true\n","true\n","Adventures_in_OOP_Land.md\n"]}],"source":["# My Solution\n","\n","class File\n","  attr_accessor :name, :byte_content\n","\n","  def initialize(name)\n","    @name = name\n","  end\n","\n","  alias_method :read,  :byte_content\n","  alias_method :write, :byte_content=\n","\n","  def copy(target_file_name)\n","    target_file = self.class.new(target_file_name)\n","    target_file.write(read)\n","\n","    target_file\n","  end\n","\n","  def to_s\n","    \"#{name}.#{self.class::FORMAT}\"\n","  end\n","end\n","\n","class MarkdownFile < File\n","  FORMAT = :md\n","end\n","\n","class VectorGraphicsFile < File\n","  FORMAT = :svg\n","end\n","\n","class MP3File < File\n","  FORMAT = :mp3\n","end\n","\n","# Test\n","\n","blog_post = MarkdownFile.new('Adventures_in_OOP_Land')\n","blog_post.write('Content will be added soon!'.bytes)\n","\n","copy_of_blog_post = blog_post.copy('Same_Adventures_in_OOP_Land')\n","\n","puts copy_of_blog_post.is_a?
