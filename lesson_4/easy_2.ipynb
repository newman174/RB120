Doesn't the `choices` called in the implementation of Oracle's `predict_the_future` look in the `Oracle` class for a `choices` method?  The answer is that since we're calling `predict_the_future` on an instance of `RoadTrip`, every time Ruby tries to resolve a method name, it will start with the methods defined on the class you are calling.  So even though the call to `choices` happens in a method defined in `Oracle`, Ruby will first look for a definition of `choices` in `RoadTrip` before falling back to `Oracle` if it does not find `choices` defined in `RoadTrip`.  To see this in action, change the name of the `choices` method in `RoadTrip` (call it `chooses`) and see what happens.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Question 3\n","\n","How do you find where Ruby will look for a method when that method is called?
